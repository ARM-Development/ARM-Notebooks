    "In this tutorial, we have shown you how to download data from ARM's Data Live web service, visualize the data and QC information, query the DQR webservice, filter data based on the QC, and add new QC tests to the dataset.  After all this work, you can easily save the xarray object to a NetCDF file using `obj.to_netcdf('filename.nc')` and all that data will be saved and usable in Python and ACT.\n",
