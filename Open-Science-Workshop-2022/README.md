# Overview

The ARM/ASR Open Science Virtual Workshop 2022 will serve as a mechanism to bring this larger community together to discuss and collaborate on open science topics, which include but are not limited to software, hardware, and data.

The aim of this workshop is to expose attendees to the spectrum of open science occurring in the ARM and ASR communities while breaking down information silos. This is a four-day workshop that will take place Tuesday, May 10, to Friday, May 13, from noon to 4 p.m. Eastern each day. 

Presentations and tutorials are being solicited from the ARM/ASR and broader scientific communities on all aspects of open science related to the missions of ARM and ASR.
