# Background
These tutorials cover ARM's JupyterHub resources, basic python, and the [Atmospheric data Community Toolkit (ACT)](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT). These tutorials are meant to be generic enough to be able to be utilized for many different events as an introduction to ACT. 

# Tutorials
## Atmospheric data Community Toolkit
The ACT tutorials were focused around exploring aerosol and lidar data from a dust event during TRacking Aerosol Convection interations ExpeRiment (TRACER) that occurred from July 16-19, 2022.

### JupyterHub and Jupyter Notebooks
[1-jupter_intro.ipynb](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/1-jupyter_intro.ipynb) is a notebook to get started with ARM's JupyterHub resources and navigate what JupyterHub notebooks are and some useful shortcuts.

### Python Tutorials
[2-Python-Basics.ipynb](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/2-Python-Basics.ipynb) is a what it seems, a notebook to go over beginner Python skills.  For those wanting to explore some more complex libraries in Python, checkout the other notebooks
- [2a-scientific_libraries_numpy.ipynb](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/2a-scientific_libraries_numpy.ipynb)
- [2b-scientific_libraries_pandas.ipynb](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/2b-scientific_libraries_pandas.ipynb)
- [2c-scientific_libraries_xarray.ipynb](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/2c-scientific_libraries_xarray.ipynb)

### Atmospheric data Community Toolkit (ACT) Tutorials
- [3-ACT-Basics-2023.ipynb](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/3-ACT-Basics.ipynb) is a base tutorial using data from the TRACER Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP) to explore some of the base functionality of ACT including visualizations and working with quality control information.

- [3a-ACT-TRACER-Dust.ipyn](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/3a-ACT-TRACER-Dust.ipynb) is a notebook to bring a variety of datasets together for visualization and performing some of the more complex operations in ACT to produce a figure like the below.

### Additional Tutorials
There are two additional tutorials for an [Introduction to GitHub and git](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/optional_github_intro.md) and how to perform [Branching and Pull Requests](https://github.com/ARM-Development/ARM-Notebooks/blob/main/Tutorials/ACT-Python-Tutorial/optional_github_branching.md) which are all very important when contributing work back into these open-source packages.
