    "The third ARM Mobile Facility (AMF3) has deployed to Bankhead National Forest in northern Alabama, opening October 1, 2024.  For at least five years, the BNF will investigate the complex interactions among clouds, vegetation, and aerosols suspended in the atmosphere.  This will be done using the instrumentation at the main site, 43-meter tower site, and three supplemental sites in the region.  This tutorial will provide an introduction to ACT using the BNF data.\n",

These are variables within the file that have information on automated tests that have been applied.  Many times, they include Min, Max, and Delta tests but as is the case with the AOS instruments, there can be more complicated tests that are applied.\n",

We won't get into the full details here, but it's a way to communicate the results of multiple tests in a single integer value by utilizing binary and bits!  You can learn more about bit-packed QC [here](https://code.arm.gov/docs/QC-flag-examples/-/wikis/home) but ACT also has many of the tools for working with ARM QC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Sources of Quality Control\n",
    "ARM also communicates problems with the data quality through Data Quality Reports (DQR).  These reports are normally submitted by the instrument mentor when there's been a problem with the instrument.  The categories include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Quality Report Categories**\n",
    "    - Missing: Data are not available or set to -9999\n",
