    "## Quality Controlling Data\n",
    "\n",
    "ARM has multiple methods that it uses to communicate data quality information out to the users.  One of these methods is through \"embedded QC\" variables.  These are variables within the file that have information on automated tests that have been applied.  Many times, they include Min, Max, and Delta tests but as is the case with the AOS instruments, there can be more complicated tests that are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from all these different tests are stored in a single variable using bit-packed QC.  We won't get into the full details here, but it's a way to communicate the results of multiple tests in a single integer value by utilizing binary and bits!  You can learn more about bit-packed QC [here](https://code.arm.gov/docs/QC-flag-examples/-/wikis/home) but ACT also has many of the tools for working with ARM QC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Sources of Quality Control\n",
    "ARM also communicates problems with the data quality through Data Quality Reports (DQR).  These reports are normally submitted by the instrument mentor when there's been a problem with the instrument.  The categories include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Quality Report Categories**\n",
    "    - Missing: Data are not available or set to -9999\n",
    "    - Suspect: The data are not fully incorrect but there are problems that increases the uncertainty of the values. Data should be used with caution.\n",
    "    - Bad: The data are incorrect and should not be used.\n",
    "    - Note: Data notes are a way to communicate information that would be useful to the end user but does not rise to the level of suspect or bad data\n",
    "    \n",
    "Additionally, data quality information can be found in the Instrument Handbooks, which are included on most instrument pages.  Here is an [example](https://www.arm.gov/publications/tech_reports/handbooks/psap_handbook.pdf) of the PSAP handbook."
