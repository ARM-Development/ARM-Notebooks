# ARM-Notebooks

## Overview
This is a repository for holding notebooks related to ARM data.
It is currently structured around the ARM environment.

* Instrument stores notebooks that deal mainly with ARM instruments.
* Modeling stores notebooks related to modeling data
* VAP stores notbooks that deal mostly with ARM instruments.
* Tutorial stores notebooks related to tutorials given as part of 
conferences, workshops, meetings, etc...

## Relation to the ARM Data Workbench
These notebooks integrate well with the ARM Data Workbench, with the primary platform being the ARM Jupyterhub (https://jupyterhub.arm.gov). We work with both ARM users and infrastructure developers to ensure that these notebooks run seamlessly on this platform. We encourage community members to use these notebooks as examples, and consider submitting their own content. We provide templates for notebooks and tutorial schedules in the `/Templates` directory.

## Getting Started
A guide on getting started with the notebooks is provided on the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page.
