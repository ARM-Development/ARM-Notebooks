# Value Added Products

[Value-added products (VAPs)](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/science-data-products/vaps) are higher-order data products that have been analyzed and processed to ease scientists’ use of ARM data in atmospheric research and global climate models.

VAPs are created by using existing ARM datastreams as input. Scientists work as translators analyzing the data in conjunction with research community needs, and then applying algorithms or models to enhance users’ scientific research and model development. VAPs provide an important translation between the instrumental measurements and the geophysical quantities needed for scientific analysis.

Priorities for VAP development needs are solicited from the research community in cooperation with the translator team.
